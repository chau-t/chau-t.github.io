Hi,
Here there are some code I wrote in Stata, R and Python in my attempt to help analyze churn for a small non-profit(refer to 
churn folder for a snippet of the code written in R) and to replicate published papers in Economics (the dialysis folder has the 
Stata do file that I am currently working on to produce results from a paper on quality-quantity tradeoff while the differentiated goods
folder has some code in Python for demand and supply estimation in a differentiated goods market).

The replication attempts are currently in progress and I hope to finish them soon.
